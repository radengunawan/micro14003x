### Context of the Problem

This problem is focused on determining the optimal fraction of users (\( F^* \)) who should adopt FacePhone in order to maximize social welfare, taking into account both the individual payoffs for using FacePhone and GPhone, and the overall benefits to society.

### Key Concepts and Terms:

1. **Social Welfare Maximization**:
   - **Social Welfare** refers to the overall well-being or total utility of society. In this context, it involves maximizing the combined benefits to all participants (FacePhone and GPhone users) in the market.
   - The problem asks to find the fraction \( F^* \) at which the average payoff to all participants is maximized, which corresponds to the point where social welfare is highest.

2. **Payoff Functions (\( \pi_F \) and \( \pi_G \))**:
   - \( \pi_F \) is the payoff function for FacePhone users, and \( \pi_G \) is the payoff function for GPhone users. The payoffs are influenced by the fraction of the population using FacePhone (\( F \)).
   - These functions indicate how much benefit or utility a user gets from choosing one phone over the other.

3. **Optimal Fraction \( F^* \)**:
   - \( F^* \) is the fraction of the population that should use FacePhone to maximize social welfare.
   - The problem is asking for the value of \( F^* \) where the total benefits (social welfare) are at their peak.

### Understanding the Solution:

1. **Identifying \( F^* \)**:
   - The solution indicates that \( F^* \) lies in the range \( 0.63 < F^* < 1 \). This means that the optimal fraction of FacePhone users is somewhere between 63% and 100% of the population.
   - This conclusion is drawn by examining the behavior of the payoff functions \( \pi_F \) and \( \pi_G \) as \( F \) increases.

2. **Why \( F^* \) Is Not Exactly 1**:
   - If \( F^* \) were 1 (i.e., everyone uses FacePhone), then the payoff for GPhone users (\( \pi_G \)) would stop increasing after \( F = 0.88 \), while \( \pi_F \) would also stop increasing or could even decrease. This would mean that the marginal social benefit of more people switching to FacePhone does not justify a complete switch.
   - Thus, moving all the way to \( F = 1 \) does not maximize social welfare because the payoff for GPhone users (\( \pi_G \)) exceeds the payoff for FacePhone users (\( \pi_F \)) at high values of \( F \). This indicates diminishing returns or even negative externalities as more users adopt FacePhone.

3. **Explaining \( F^* \) within the Range \( 0.63 < F^* < 1 \)**:
   - The explanation provided suggests that between \( F = 0.63 \) and \( F = 1 \), there are further gains to be made in social welfare. This is because both payoff functions continue to rise as \( F \) increases past \( 0.63 \), but they don't both rise indefinitely.
   - The optimal point \( F^* \) must be where the combined payoff (or average payoff) across all users is at its highest. This occurs somewhere between \( F = 0.63 \) and \( F = 1 \), where the additional benefits of increasing \( F \) still outweigh the costs.

4. **Marginal Social Benefit vs. Marginal Private Benefit**:
   - The explanation highlights that on the right side of \( F = 0.63 \), the **marginal social benefit** (the benefit to society as a whole) of more people using FacePhone is still positive, even if the marginal private benefit (the benefit to individual users) might not be as high.
   - This discrepancy leads to the conclusion that the socially optimal \( F^* \) is in the range \( 0.63 < F^* < 1 \), rather than exactly at \( F = 1 \).

### Summary:

The problem is about finding the fraction of the population that should use FacePhone to maximize overall social welfare. By analyzing the payoff functions for FacePhone and GPhone users, the solution identifies that the optimal fraction \( F^* \) lies between 63% and 100% of the population, but not exactly at 100%. This balance reflects the point where the benefits to society are maximized, taking into account both the payoffs to individual users and the overall effect on social welfare.

### Marginal Social Benefit (MSB)

**Definition**:  
Marginal Social Benefit (MSB) is the additional benefit to society as a whole that results from consuming or producing one more unit of a good or service. It includes all the benefits that individuals receive (private benefits) plus any external benefits that others in society might receive as a result.

**Analogy**:  
Imagine a community garden where each person who plants a flower not only enjoys the beauty of their own flowers (private benefit) but also contributes to the overall beauty of the garden that everyone in the neighborhood can enjoy (social benefit). If one more person plants a flower, the garden looks even better, increasing the joy for everyone. The additional joy everyone gets from that one extra flower is the marginal social benefit.

### Diminishing Returns

**Definition**:  
Diminishing returns occur when, as more of a particular input (such as labor or capital) is added to a fixed amount of other inputs, the additional output (or benefit) produced from each additional unit of input starts to decrease. In other words, each additional unit of input yields less and less extra output.

**Analogy**:  
Imagine you're baking cookies and you have a fixed amount of dough. Initially, adding more chocolate chips makes each cookie taste better. However, as you keep adding more and more chocolate chips, eventually, the cookies start to become overwhelmingly chocolatey, and the benefit of adding more chips decreases. At some point, adding even more chips doesn't improve the cookies much at all—instead, it might even make them less enjoyable. This decline in the benefit from adding more chips is an example of diminishing returns.

### Marginal Private Benefit (MPB)

**Definition**:  
Marginal Private Benefit (MPB) is the additional benefit that an individual or firm receives from consuming or producing one more unit of a good or service, without considering any benefits or costs to others. It represents the personal gain from an additional unit of activity.

**Analogy**:  
Think about a person who buys a cup of coffee. The enjoyment and energy boost they get from drinking the coffee is their private benefit. If they decide to buy a second cup, the extra enjoyment they get from the second cup is the marginal private benefit. This benefit is purely personal and doesn’t take into account how their coffee drinking might affect others, such as the added noise in the cafe or the environmental impact of producing another cup.

### Summary of Relationships

- **Marginal Private Benefit (MPB)** focuses solely on the benefit to the individual making a decision (like enjoying a second cup of coffee).
- **Marginal Social Benefit (MSB)** includes both the MPB and any external benefits that spill over to others (like the communal enjoyment of a well-tended garden).
- **Diminishing Returns** explain how adding more of something (like chocolate chips to cookies) eventually leads to smaller and smaller improvements or benefits, which can affect both MPB and MSB if overuse reduces the overall benefit.

### Explanation of "On the right of 0.63, the marginal social benefit of using FacePhone over GPhone is positive, while the marginal private benefit is not":

This statement is key to understanding the dynamics of the payoff functions and how they relate to social welfare and individual decisions.

### Context Recap:
- \( F \) represents the fraction of the population using FacePhone.
- At \( F = 0.63 \), a significant portion of the population uses FacePhone, but there are still people using GPhone.
- The concept of **marginal social benefit** (MSB) and **marginal private benefit** (MPB) helps us understand why the optimal level of FacePhone adoption is between 0.63 and 1, but not necessarily 1.

### Breakdown of the Statement:

1. **Marginal Social Benefit (MSB) of Using FacePhone**:
   - **Positive on the Right of 0.63**: 
     - The statement indicates that as more people adopt FacePhone (moving to the right of 0.63), the overall benefit to society still increases. This means that every additional person switching from GPhone to FacePhone still brings some positive external benefits to the rest of society, even if the increase is small.
     - These social benefits might include things like improved communication among users due to the network effects, where more people can share statuses, and thus the overall connectivity and utility increase.

2. **Marginal Private Benefit (MPB) of Using FacePhone**:
   - **Not Positive on the Right of 0.63**: 
     - The statement suggests that for individual users, the personal gain from switching to FacePhone decreases as \( F \) goes beyond 0.63. In other words, the incentive for an individual to switch from GPhone to FacePhone becomes weaker because the additional benefit they receive is small or even negligible.
     - This could happen if, for instance, the novelty of using FacePhone wears off, or if the privacy concerns begin to outweigh the network benefits for individuals, even though society as a whole still gains from increased adoption.

### Analogy to Clarify:

Imagine a small town where most people have regular cars (GPhone) and some have electric cars (FacePhone). When the town first started adopting electric cars, each new electric car owner not only benefited personally from lower fuel costs (MPB) but also helped reduce pollution for everyone (MSB). 

- **At \( F = 0.63 \)**: Let’s say that 63% of the town has switched to electric cars. Up to this point, both the individual benefits (lower fuel costs) and the social benefits (less pollution) were significant.

- **Beyond \( F = 0.63 \)**: As more people switch to electric cars (moving to the right of 0.63), the individual benefit for a new adopter starts to diminish. Maybe the cost of electric cars is high, or the town already has clean air, so the personal incentive to switch isn't strong. However, the town as a whole still benefits from each additional electric car because it further reduces pollution or traffic noise, even if these benefits are small.

### Conclusion:

- **Marginal Social Benefit (MSB)** remains positive beyond \( F = 0.63 \) because society as a whole continues to gain from more people using FacePhone.
- **Marginal Private Benefit (MPB)** is not positive beyond \( F = 0.63 \) because the additional personal gain for individuals diminishes. This could lead to fewer people choosing to adopt FacePhone based purely on their own benefit, even though the society-wide benefits of further adoption still exist.

This difference is why the optimal fraction \( F^* \) lies between 0.63 and 1, rather than exactly at 1. Society as a whole would benefit from more people using FacePhone, but individual incentives might not align with this, leading to a potential under-adoption from a social welfare perspective.

### Explanation of the Green Dotted Plot

In the solution explanation, the green dotted line represents the **average payoff** to all participants in the market at each value of \( F \). This line is different from the blue and red curves, which represent the individual payoffs for FacePhone users (\( \pi_F \)) and GPhone users (\( \pi_G \)).

### Breakdown of the Different Curves:

1. **Blue Curve (\( \pi_F \))**:
   - This curve represents the **payoff** or benefit to **FacePhone users** as the fraction \( F \) of the population using FacePhone increases.
   - As \( F \) increases, the payoff for FacePhone users increases due to network effects, but it eventually levels off and may even decline slightly as potential negative effects (e.g., privacy concerns) begin to outweigh the benefits.

2. **Red Curve (\( \pi_G \))**:
   - This curve represents the **payoff** or benefit to **GPhone users** as the fraction \( F \) of the population using FacePhone increases.
   - As \( F \) increases, fewer people use GPhone, so the payoff to GPhone users decreases. This is because GPhone users might feel left out of the network effects that benefit FacePhone users. However, since GPhone doesn't have the status-sharing feature, the payoff is more consistent, declining steadily rather than sharply.

3. **Green Dotted Line (Average Payoff)**:
   - The green dotted line represents the **average payoff** to all participants, regardless of whether they use FacePhone or GPhone.
   - This average payoff is calculated by considering the combined benefits of both FacePhone and GPhone users at each value of \( F \). Mathematically, it can be expressed as:
     \[
     \text{Average Payoff} = (1 - F) \times \pi_G + F \times \pi_F
     \]
   - Here, \( (1 - F) \) is the fraction of the population using GPhone, and \( F \) is the fraction using FacePhone. The formula essentially weighs the payoffs of the two groups based on how many people belong to each group.

### Differences and Interpretation:

1. **Purpose of the Green Dotted Line**:
   - The green dotted line is used to evaluate **social welfare**—it helps to determine the overall well-being of all users in the market as \( F \) changes.
   - The goal is to find the value of \( F \) that maximizes this average payoff, which corresponds to the value where the green dotted line reaches its highest point. This value of \( F \) is the optimal fraction \( F^* \) where social welfare is maximized.

2. **Differences from Blue and Red Curves**:
   - **Individual vs. Average Payoff**:
     - The blue and red curves reflect the payoffs to specific groups (FacePhone users and GPhone users, respectively).
     - The green dotted line averages these payoffs, giving a single value that reflects the overall payoff to society at each level of \( F \).
   - **Behavior Across \( F \)**:
     - As \( F \) increases, the individual payoffs change in different ways (FacePhone users benefit more as \( F \) increases, while GPhone users benefit less).
     - The green dotted line smooths these changes into a single trend that reflects the combined effects on all users. It may rise or fall more gradually compared to the individual payoff curves, reflecting how shifts in \( F \) impact the market as a whole rather than just one group.

### Summary:

- The **green dotted line** is a measure of **social welfare**, representing the average payoff to all users in the market as \( F \) changes.
- The **blue curve** shows how much FacePhone users benefit as more people adopt FacePhone.
- The **red curve** shows how GPhone users' benefits decline as more people switch to FacePhone.
- The green dotted line helps identify the value of \( F \) (denoted \( F^* \)) that maximizes social welfare, which is the point where the average payoff is highest. This optimal \( F^* \) lies between 0.63 and 1, indicating the best balance of adoption for maximizing overall benefit to society.

### Explanation of the Red Curve (\( \pi_G \))

The **red curve** represents the **payoff** (\( \pi_G \)) to **GPhone users** as the fraction \( F \) of the population using FacePhone increases.

### Observations from the Plot:
- **Constant Slope**: The red curve increases with a constant slope, which suggests that as more people adopt FacePhone (\( F \) increases), the benefit (or payoff) to GPhone users rises at a steady rate.
- **Intersection with Blue Curve**: The red curve intersects with the blue curve (FacePhone payoff) at certain points, which represent equilibrium points where the payoffs for using FacePhone and GPhone are equal.

### Why Does the Red Curve Increase with a Constant Slope?

1. **Privacy and Non-Participation Benefits**:
   - The red curve’s behavior can be understood by considering the **benefits of not participating** in the status-sharing network of FacePhone. 
   - As more people switch to FacePhone and start sharing their statuses automatically, those who stick with GPhone may find increasing value in **maintaining their privacy** and avoiding the constant broadcasting of their personal information.
   - This could be because GPhone users appreciate the privacy they retain by not joining FacePhone. As \( F \) increases, the relative value of this privacy (and possibly the avoidance of status-sharing overload) continues to rise steadily, leading to a constant slope.

2. **Lack of Network Externalities for GPhone**:
   - GPhone doesn't benefit from the same kind of **network externalities** that FacePhone does. Network externalities occur when the value of a product increases as more people use it. For GPhone, however, the value isn't directly tied to how many others use it.
   - Instead, the payoff to GPhone users might be more about the consistent benefits they receive, such as privacy or control over their information. Because this value is not dependent on the number of GPhone users, the payoff increases at a steady rate as more people switch to FacePhone, leaving a smaller group that values GPhone’s features.

3. **Interpretation of Constant Slope**:
   - The constant slope of the red curve suggests that each additional person switching to FacePhone adds a fixed amount of relative benefit to GPhone users. This could be interpreted as a steady increase in the relative privacy or exclusivity enjoyed by GPhone users as FacePhone becomes more prevalent.

### Summary:

The red curve's constant slope indicates that as the fraction \( F \) of FacePhone users increases, the payoff to GPhone users increases steadily. This is likely due to the consistent value that GPhone users place on not participating in FacePhone's status-sharing feature, which becomes more valuable as more people adopt FacePhone. The increase in payoff reflects the growing relative benefits of privacy, control, or non-participation, which remain consistent as \( F \) rises. 

This behavior contrasts with the blue curve, where the payoff to FacePhone users increases more rapidly at first due to network externalities but eventually levels off or decreases as \( F \) approaches 1.
